# Quick Start
First, clone the podcaster ai repository to a directory of your choosing using a command such as:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:yakaboskic/podcaster-ai.git
```
### Download Data Files
There are a number of necessary data files required to run Podcaster AI. They are various model files as well as data files that I prefer not to package in the github repo for faster cloning speeds. These data files are hosted at Zenodo at the following [link](https://zenodo.org/records/10460039). 

Once you navigate to the link download the data files to a folder in labeled `data` that lines in the root directory of your cloned podcaster-ai directory.
